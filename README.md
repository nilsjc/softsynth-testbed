# A software synth test bed
In this repository you will find experiments done with the PortAudio sound API.<br>
PortAudio is a free and cross-platform sound API made by Ross Bencina.<br>

My plan, in the future, is to make a, kind of, modular synth. Meanwhile i will test different sound modules in the main loop.<br> 
And for now you will find a reverb module that will process any incoming sound from the PC microphone. The reverb is BTW based on the famous(?) Dattorro reverb.

In the root folder "builtprogram" you will find ready made .exe files(for use in Windows) that will contain my sound experiments. The first one being the above mentioned lush reverb.
